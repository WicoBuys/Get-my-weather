# Get-my-weather

This weather app is a simple wheater web app that uses a local API to get weather data and display it to you.

You simply put in your town name and you will get a simple print out of the current data for your town, 
like temperature, weather, humidity and pressure.

Note: this web app is only for my own skills development and it can only display a limited amount of information.
